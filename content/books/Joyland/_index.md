* I would argue that - fantasies aside - the majority of men are monogamous from the chin up. Below the belt-buckle, however, there's a wahoo stampeder who just doesn't give a shit.  (p117)

* I can't understand why people use religion to hurt each other when there's already so much pain in the world. Religion is supposed to comfort. (p168)
