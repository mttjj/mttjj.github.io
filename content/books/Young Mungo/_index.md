* A fissure Mungo hadn't known about cracked open in his chest; beneath it was a hollow feeling that had never bothered him before. It was an agony not to raise his own hand and touch the hairs James's fingers had licked. It burned. He wanted nothing more than to feel the warmth left by his touch. (p228)
