### Quotes



* At that moment the power of reading made itself clear and real to me. If I could see the words, then no one could control them or what I got from them. They couldn't even know if I was merely seeing them or reading them, sounding them out or comprehending them. It was a completely private affair and completely free and, therefore, completely subversive. (p73)

* A man who refused to own slaves but was not opposed to others owning slaves was still a slaver, to my thinking. (p176)
