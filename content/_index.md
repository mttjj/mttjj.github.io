Welcome to this website. It's probably not exciting but it definitely is something.

The Media Diet section is where you can find my (nearly) daily log of all the media that I consume. The listings in those posts link back to media that can be found in the Media section. I’m not entirely sure why I keep such detailed logs, but I hope you find something interesting while you’re here.
