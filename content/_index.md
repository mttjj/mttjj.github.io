Welcome to this website. It's probably not exciting but it definitely is something.

The Media Diet section is where you can find my (nearly) daily log of all the media that I consume. The listings in those posts link back to media that can be found in the Media section. Why do I keep such detailed logs? No idea. I know it's weird and possibly even a little concerning but if that's not your thing, that's fine; there are plenty of other websites out there for you.
